Create a json object

var college=['name':,'place':];

To add objects
college.push({object});

To print all objects
console.log(object);
JSON.stringify(object);

To access
object[0]['name'] or object[0].name

To print all
for var c of colleges{
console.log(c.name);
}

dynamic values to access
ex : var key="name"
for var c of colleges{
console.log(c[key]); //.key will not work because key will be converted to string and it searches for the string
			//whereas if [key] it substitutes the value of key and searches json.
}
