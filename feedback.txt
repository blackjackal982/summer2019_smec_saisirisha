Feedback on mentors:

Vineeth bhaiya was super awesome while teaching and the way he demonstrated the entire procedure of automating ttd
booking was extraordinary.

Vishal bhaiya taught really well.The way he taught frontend really gave rebirth to interest on frontend again in me.

Nikhil bhaiya's classs bored me sometimes reason being I was on the last desk and he used to write really small .We 
could not see what he was writing most of the time.During code walkthrough also it was really faster that I could not 
cope up to the speed.

Aravind bhaiya taught the concepts well but I expected more of js concepts.

Rohini sir's classes was awesome.I loved all of his classes and learnt many concepts from him.

OLN sir also taught well keeping the fact apart tha in his class I slept a lot because I could not sleep on compiler's
night.

KC sir's classes were extraordinarily interesting and awesome. I personally liked them a lot. The way sir looks at
life and  his perspectives taught me not to worry about little things. KC sir also gave really good teaching on how 
to handle stress and worries.

Feedback on team mentors:

1.I was in team4 and our mentors were really helpful .Though they couldn't come daily but they were in constant touch 
with us on fb

Feedback on daily mentors:
I exactly don't remember who said this but once when I had a doubt and asked daily mentor he refused to help and told me
to ask our team mentor during file systems class.

Generic Feedback:
Swapping team members was a really good call sir but it would have been great if you switched places of the entire team.
I already gave this feedback to Peri Sir.
